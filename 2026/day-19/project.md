# Shell Scripting Project: Log Rotation, Backup & Crontab

## Task 1: Log Rotation Script

Create log_rotate.sh that:

  - Takes a log directory as an argument (e.g., /var/log/myapp)
  - Compresses .log files older than 7 days using gzip
  - Deletes .gz files older than 30 days
  - Prints how many files were compressed and deleted
  - Exits with an error if the directory doesn't exist
